# AutoUpdateNFIX2
Python script that automates the update of the freqtrade strategy of NostalgiaForInfinityX2 (https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity) and/or the blacklist and/or pairlist associated with your exchange.

## âš¡ How does it work?
The script checks the online and local version of the strategy and/or blacklist and/or pairlist.
There are 4 files available:
- update_strategy.py: update only the strategy
- update_strategy_blacklist.py: update of strategy and blacklist
- update_strategy_pairlist.py: update of strategy and pairlist
- update_strategy_blacklist_pairlist.py: update of the strategy, the blacklist and the pairlist
 
If there is a difference, it updates the local version, restarts the docker, and notifies the user on Telegram of the update.

## ðŸ”§ Adapt the script
You have to modify the following variables with the path of your repo and, optionally, the name of your docker service :
```
rootdir = "/your-path/" # directory where you've cloned the repo
docker_service = "" # (optional) docker service name that needs to be restarted (defaults to all)
```
You must also adapt the URLs of the blacklist and the pairlist with the ones adapted to your exchange :
```
url_blacklist = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity/main/configs/blacklist-kucoin.json"
file_blacklist = rootdir + "/configs/blacklist-kucoin.json"
url_pairlist = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity/main/configs/pairlist-volume-kucoin-usdt.json"
file_pairlist = rootdir + "/configs/pairlist-volume-kucoin-usdt.json"
```
You must also enter your Telegram token and chat-id to receive notifications when updates are made:
```
bot_token = "6XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX8U"
chat_id = "12XXXXX35"
```

## ðŸ“¤ Automatically run the script :
###  ðŸ•– With a cron:
Personally I want the script to be executed every hour to be updated as often as possible. To do this I run the following command on my server:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
And I add the following line:
```
15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /your-path/update_strategy.py >> /var/log/logs_update_strategy.log 2>&1
```
### ðŸ’» With a script:
For people who don't have access to the cron of their server it is possible to use this script (provided by mandark of the NFI Discord/@Mandark-droid
):
```
 #!/bin/bash
while [ : ]
do
    dt=date +%d-%m-%y-%H:%M:%S
    echo "Last pole :" $dt
        cd /home/user/; python update_strategy_blacklist_pairlist.py >> log_update_strategy.log 2>&1
    sleep 600 ## Update this based on how frequently you want to run the script.
done
```
Save this as run_cron.sh and execute as :
```
nohup sh run_cron.sh &
```
## ðŸš€ Next developments:
- [x] Update the blacklist associated with his exchange and his crypto currency at the same time
- [x] Update the pairlist associated with his exchange and his crypto currency at the same time
- [ ] Automatic execution of the script at each commit of the NFI repo.
